# Econometrics-GGR
Econometrics-GGR is an open source platform for econometrics. It has tools, libraries, and community resources that let researchers push the state-of-the-art in econometrics and developers easily build and deploy econometrics-powered applications.  Econometrics-GGR was originally developed by Gerardo Gomez Ruano to provide Python tools for econometricians and data-scientists. The libraries are general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.
